# swagger-fixer
Fixer for invalid swagger 1.2 to valid ones so that they can be processed by standard tooling.

Note that this is a small utility, that should be self deprecating.

Command line parameters are:

`-i <inputs>`

`-o output directory`

`-w <root working directory to which other directories may be relative>`
